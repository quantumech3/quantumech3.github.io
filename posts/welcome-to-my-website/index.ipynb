    "Hello! Welcome to my website. I will be posting blogs about things I find interesting. I try my best to keep up to date in the latest research in Graphics. I discovered that I get more out of what I read when writing about it after. So thats why I write blogs. I am also trying to learn more about the process of research itself and I see blogging as an excersize to push me to grow in that sense.\n",

    "*This* blog is dedicated to showing you who I am though. You won't see much about my technical accomplishments here unfortunately because I want to keep this blog brief, and I feel my [resume](/resume.pdf) should be sufficient if you want my technical achievements. I will also primarily be writing about technical topics after this blog so you will get a good sense of my professional interests then."

The first day I walked into this lab, his PhD student sat me down on a chair facing a few cameras. I had no idea what was going on. I figured they were taking my picture, but I didn't know that they were getting a LiDAR scan of my face! You can see the utter confusion in my eyes above."

Ever since then, whenever I got the chance to bring a friend to the lab, I would always sit them down, tell them nothing, scan their face, and watch their reaction after. Its just so funny. "

You can come in with an idea, but thats different from a concrete objective for what your making. That makes this medium unique from the rest of them.\n",

But he is one of the few artists who make sounds that I truely don't know how to reproduce. He makes excellent breakdowns on YouTube of each of his songs though."
