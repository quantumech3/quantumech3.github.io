    "text": "Introduction\nHello! Welcome to my website. I will be posting blogs about things I find interesting. I try my best to keep up to date in the latest research in Graphics. I discovered that I get more out of what I read when writing about it after. So thats why I write blogs. I am also trying to learn more about the process of research itself and I see blogging as an excersize to push me to grow in that sense.\nI can‚Äôt promise a regular upload schedule because I am balancing this with my classes, but I will try my best.\nThis blog is dedicated to showing you who I am though. You won‚Äôt see much about my technical accomplishments here unfortunately because I want to keep this blog brief, and I feel my resume should be sufficient if you want my technical achievements. I will also primarily be writing about technical topics after this blog so you will get a good sense of my professional interests then.\n\n\nMy Creepy Profile Picture\n\n\n\nMy profile picture\n\n\nSigh, I got some explaining to do I guess‚Ä¶ This profile pic is a 3D scan of my face that was taken when I was doing conformal mapping research with a professor and his team a few years ago. The first day I walked into this lab, his PhD student sat me down on a chair facing a few cameras. I had no idea what was going on. I figured they were taking my picture, but I didn‚Äôt know that they were getting a LiDAR scan of my face! You can see the utter confusion in my eyes above.\nIts the initiation into the group. Every member of the team gets his/her face scanned. I knew from that moment on that this screenshot of my face in MeshLab had to be my profile picture. Ever since then, whenever I got the chance to bring a friend to the lab, I would always sit them down, tell them nothing, scan their face, and watch their reaction after. Its just so funny.\n\n\nMy Previous Blogs\n\nCutting a Square into 3rds\n\nSince the project I was on concluded, I have been spending my time writing blogs. I originally was on Medium, but they took away the ability to theme my blogs, like the one above, the way I wanted üò≠. So I decided to make my own website with no paywalls or restrictions.\n\n\nOther hobbies\nI am an ‚Äúartist‚Äù. In particular, I like photography, drawing, 3D modeling, and digital music production. Ill only show 2 of these here so I don‚Äôt drag out the blog for too long.\n\nMusic production\n\nMy SoundCloud\n\nSo.. this is now the part where I desparately plug my SoundCloud like a true professional. BUT WAIT, DONT GO! I promise it gets better from here!\nI like making music because its one of the most abstract forms of art. When you draw something for example, you start that drawing with a goal: to make a coherent depiction of the object your trying to capture. This is not true for music though. You can come in with an idea, but thats different from a concrete objective for what your making. That makes this medium unique from the rest of them.\nThere are 2 musicians I think you should check out if your looking to learn digital audio production:\n\nAndrew Hwang: He is a YouTuber who makes a wide range of music. You may have heard of him, but if you haven‚Äôt then you really should check him out because his tutorials are excellent and I learned alot of what I know from him.\nAu5: He makes dubstep tracks. I don‚Äôt actually play instruments myself but I am familiar enough in synthwork and sound design. But he is one of the few artists who make sounds that I truely don‚Äôt know how to reproduce. He makes excellent breakdowns on YouTube of each of his songs though.\n\n\n\nPhotography\nGraphics is my primary interest, but one of the reasons that I got into computer vision was because of photography. I probably burnt you out with my rant in the last second so I will just show you a bunch of photos I took:\n\n\n\nSunset at Pinnacle Mountain\n\n\n\n\n\nNight sky in Vermont\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowers\n\n\n\n\n\nCandy Ocean in Port Jefferson\n\n\nAlmost all my best photos are taken at sunset I think. Atleast in my opinion. But heres a photo that breaks the trend:\n\n\n\nPuppy marble\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nI showed you some of my hobbies, and blogging experience. Most of the blogs from here on are going to be technical, and alot more interesting in my opinion. But I figured it would be good to show you my personality a little in case your interested.\nTill the next blog! üê∂"
